<td><h1><br>Selected Papers on Analysis of Algorithms
</h1></td></tr></table>
by Donald E. Knuth (Stanford, California:
 Center for the Study of Language and Information, 2000), xvi+621 pp.<br>
(CSLI Lecture Notes, no. 102.)<br>
ISBN 1-57586-212-3<br>
Printings made after 2006 have xvi+622 pp., because the index has gotten longer.
<p>
This is the fourth in a
<a href="selected.html">series of eight volumes</a>
that contain archival forms of my published papers,
together with new material. (The first book in the series was
<a href="lp.html"><cite>Literate Programming</cite></a>;
the second was
<a href="cs.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Computer Science</cite></a>;
the third was
<a href="dt.html"><cite>Digital Typography</cite></a>.)
The Analysis of Algorithms volume is characterized by the following
remarks quoted from its preface.
</p>
<blockquote>
``People who analyze algorithms have double happiness.
First of all they experience the sheer beauty of elegant mathematical patterns
that surround elegant computational procedures. Then they receive a practical
payoff when their theories make it possible to get other jobs done more
quickly and more economically.''
</blockquote><blockquote>
I once had the pleasure of writing those words for the Foreword of
<a href="http://www.informit.com/title/020140009X"><cite>An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms</cite></a>
by Robert Sedgewick and Philippe Flajolet, and I can't think of any better
way to introduce the present book. After enjoying such double happiness for
nearly forty years, I'm delighted that I can finally bring together this
collection of essays about the subject that I love most.
</blockquote><blockquote>
... Most of the chapters in this book appeared originally as research papers that
solved basic problems related to some particular algorithm or class of
algorithms. But the emphasis throughout is on techniques that are of general
interest, techniques that should lead also to the solution of tomorrow's
problems. The way a problem is solved is generally much more important than the
solution itself, and I have therefore tried to explain the principles of
solution and discovery as well as I could. Thus I believe the material in this
book remains highly relevant even though much of it was written many years ago.
I have also appended additional material to most of the chapters, explaining
subsequent developments and giving pointers to more recent literature.
</blockquote><blockquote>
... The process of compiling this book has given me an
incentive to improve some of the original wording, to make all of the
notations consistent with
<a href="taocp.html"><cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite></a>,
to doublecheck almost all of
the mathematical formulas and the reasoning that supports them, to correct all
known errors, to improve the original illustrations by redrawing them with
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html">MetaPost</a>,
and to match the bibliographic information with
original sources in the library. Thus the articles now appear in a form that I
hope will remain useful for at least another generation or two of scholars who
will carry the work forward.

<blockquote>
The papers in this book are a collection of gems that were previously
published or presented as lectures by the author. The very title bears
Knuth's signature, since it was he who introduced the phrase ``analysis
of algorithms.'' ... He presents new ``pure'' results, which is surprising
in view of the age of the topics. Generally, nobody will have the last word,
as most of the papers include a sizable supplement discussing more recent
developments. ... This collection will be highly prized by Knuth fans---in
fact, by all computer scientists.<br>--Harvey Cohn, in
<cite>Computing Reviews</cite> (July 2000)

<blockquote>
The range of topics, although mostly confined to the analysis of algorithms,
is vast. ...
To focus on any one aspect ... would give short-shrift to the others.
I therefore decided to focus this review on why I believe every reader of
SIGACT News should buy this book. ... The evolution of current technology
and fundamental unifying ideas can be found ... excellent reading for a
beginning student in algorithm analysis ... many hilarious misapplications
of theory to practice ... Knuth does an amazing job of relating <i>how</i> he
approaches problems rather than merely recording a highly polished solution
which to the reader seems to come out of the blue ... It's just plain fun
to read.<br>--Timothy H. McNicholl, in <cite>SIGACT News</cite> (March 2001)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
... combines succinctness and formal rigour with clarity and humour ...
These papers on algorithmic analysis exemplify how best to convey the
often complex mathematics lying behind the behaviour of apparently
simple techniques. ...
this collection will be of interest to those who value the highest
quality technical writing, as well as to algorithm analyzers.
<br>--Greg Michaelson, in <cite>The Computer Bulletin</cite> (May 2001)

<blockquote>
... In summary, the papers collected here give a beautiful picture of
charms and challenges of the (average-case) analysis of algorithms
by the pen of its creator.
<br>--Joachim von zur Gathen, in <cite>IEEE Annals of the History of Computing
</cite> (April--June 2002)
</blockquote>
<img src="border.gif" alt="">
<blockquote>
... The particular value of this book is that much of the material has appeared in publications which are available only with difficulty. The collection is a valuable addition to the literature.
<br>--A. D. Booth, in <cite>Mathematical Reviews</cite> (2001)
</blockquote>
<img src="border.gif" alt="">
<blockquote>
... thoughtful, thorough, and inspiring. ... Most of these papers, although
excellent in every sense of this word, are quite technical, and I certainly
don't recommend them for ``easy reading.'' ... I would whole-heartedly
recommend this book to my colleagues who have some time to spare, and who
would like to get into one of the greatest minds in computer science.
<br>--Zhizhang Shen, in <cite>Zentralblatt Math</cite> (March 2001)

<h2>
Errata
</h2>
<p>
As usual, I promise to pay a reward of
$2.56 to the first person
who finds and reports anything that remains technically, historically,
typographically, or politically incorrect.
</p>
<p>
The printing of 2012 corrected all of the previously known
<a href="aaerr1.html">errors in the original printing of 2000</a>
and
<a href="aaerr2.html">errors in the printing of 2008</a>;
the following further corrections are still needed.
An asterisk (*) marks technical errors that are not merely typographical:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>page 603, line 7</dt>
<dd>change 'cofficients' to 'coefficients'</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p> I hope the book is otherwise error-free; but (sigh) it
probably isn't, because each page presented me with hundreds of opportunities
to make mistakes. Please send suggested corrections to
<a href = "mailto:knuth-bug@cs.stanford.edu">
<tt>knuth-bug@cs.stanford.edu</tt></a>, or send snail mail to
Prof. D. Knuth, Computer Science Department, Gates Building 4B,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-9045 USA.
In either case please include your postal address, so that I can
mail an official certificate of deposit as a token of thanks for any
improvements to which you have contributed.
</p>
<p>
I may not be able to
read your message until many months have gone by, because I'm working
intensively on 
<a href="taocp.html"><cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite></a>. However,
I promise to reply in due time.
</p>
<p>
<b>DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO KNUTH-BUG EXCEPT TO REPORT ERRORS IN BOOKS!</b>
