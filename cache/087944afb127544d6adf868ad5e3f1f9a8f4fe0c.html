<td><h1><br>Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms
</h1></td></tr></table>
by Donald E. Knuth (Stanford, California:
 Center for the Study of Language and Information, 2010), xvi+453pp.<br>
(CSLI Lecture Notes, no. 191.)<br>
ISBN 1575865831 (cloth), 1575865823 (paperback)<br>
<p>
This is the seventh in a
<a href="selected.html">series of eight volumes</a>
that contain archival forms of my published papers,
together with new material. (The first book in the series was
<a href="lp.html"><cite>Literate Programming</cite></a>;
the second was
<a href="cs.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Computer Science</cite></a>;
the third was
<a href="dt.html"><cite>Digital Typography</cite></a>;
the fourth was
<a href="aa.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Analysis of Algorithms</cite></a>;
the fifth was
<a href="cl.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Computer Languages</cite></a>;
the sixth was
<a href="dm.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Discrete Mathematics</cite></a>.)
The Design of Algorithms volume is characterized by the following
remarks quoted from its preface.
</p>
<blockquote>
Algorithms are the threads that tie together most of the subfields
of computer science. This book is a collection of technical papers in
which I've tried to introduce or make improvements to algorithms for a
wide variety of intriguing tasks that have come to my attention during the
past fifty years.
I'm grateful for this opportunity to put the
materials into a consistent format, and to correct errors in the original
publications that have come to my attention. If any of this work deserves to
be remembered, it is now in the form that I most wish people to remember it.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Something magically beautiful happens when a sequence of commands and
decisions is able to marshal a collection of data into organized patterns
or to discover hidden structure. Every once in awhile something ``clicks'';
an elegant procedure suddenly emerges by which small steps combine to fulfill
a large objective---aha! On several occasions I've been lucky enough to encounter some of
these unexpected nuggets of algorithmic paydirt, and I hope that I can
communicate the essence of what makes them tick so that readers will be able
to share my pleasure.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Since many different kinds of algorithms are considered here, I've organized
this book by topic instead of by chronology. I doubt if anybody will actually
read this book straight through from Chapter 1 to Chapter 28; yet I've tried
to arrange the chapters so that such a journey will not seem like a completely
random walk. Algorithms that deal with similar topics or use similar paradigms
are therefore grouped together.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Chapter 1, however, is not about any particular algorithm. It is a eulogy to
Bob Floyd, my long-time colleague to whom this book is dedicated, because he
helped significantly to inspire so many of the ideas that are described in
the other chapters.
 I know of no better way to begin a book about the design of algorithms
than to describe Floyd's life and work.
</blockquote>
<p>
... And then the preface continues by describing the other chapters,
which can be summarized more succinctly by quoting from the hype on
the back cover:
</p>
<blockquote>
Nearly thirty of Knuth's classic papers on the subject are collected in this
book, brought up to date with extensive revisions and notes on subsequent
developments. 
Many of these algorithms have seen wide use --- for example, Knuth's
algorithm for optimum search trees, the Faller--Gallager--Knuth algorithm
for adaptive Huffman coding, the Knuth--Morris--Pratt algorithm for
pattern matching, the Dijkstra--Knuth algorithm for optimum expressions,
and the Knuth--Bendix algorithm for deducing the
consequences of axioms. Others are pedagogically important, helping
students to learn how to design new algorithms for new tasks.
One or two are significant historically, as they show how things
were done in computing's early days. All are found here, together with
more than 40 newly created illustrations.

<blockquote>
<cite>Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms</cite> bears Knuth's usual
eloquence in writing. The algorithms and proofs in each chapter are presented
cleanly, and pseudocode for implementing them accompanies most of the
algorithms. Part of the real <i>charm</i> of this collection comes from the
historical notes interspersed throughout the book. These take the form of
either additional commentary attached to the end of a paper ... explaining
which open problems have been solved, which haven't, and how the newer results
were obtained ... Gems like these are probably the best reason to own the book.

<p> I hope the book is otherwise error-free; but (sigh) it
probably isn't, because each page presented me with hundreds of opportunities
to make mistakes. Please send suggested corrections to
