In order to keep the Academic Earth Services enjoyable for all of our users, we ask you to adhere to the following rules.</p>
<p>Please choose carefully the User Material you Post. Please limit yourself to User Material directly relevant to the Academic Earth Services. Moreover, you must not Post User Material that: (a) contains Unsuitable Material; or (b) improperly claims the identity of another person. You should also be careful if you decide to Post personally identifiable information, such as your full name, email address, telephone number or street address.</p>
<p>You must be, or have first obtained permission from, the rightful owner of any User Material you Post. By submitting User Material, you represent and warrant that you own the User Material or otherwise have the right to grant Academic Earth the license provided below; you also represent and warrant that the Posting of your User Material does not violate any right of any party, including privacy rights, publicity rights, and intellectual property rights.

Without this license, we would not be able to provide your User Material in connection with the Academic Earth Services. For example, without the right to modify User Material, we could not format it to satisfy technical requirements, and without the right to publish User Material, we could not allow other users to view your User Material. The license you grant to Academic Earth is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your User Material to anyone else in addition to Academic Earth), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Academic Earth is not required to pay you for the use of your User Material), and sublicensable (so that Academic Earth is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as internet content delivery networks to provide the Academic Earth Services).

Academic Earth does not endorse any User Material, and User Material that is Posted does not reflect the opinions or policies of Academic Earth. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor User Material and to restrict or remove User Material that we determine, in our sole discretion, is inappropriate.
