<p><strong>Evolution of programming languages </strong></p>
<p>- Years 50: Creation of high-level languages ​​(closer to humans).<br>
  - Years 60: Expansion of specialized languages​​. Forth. Simula I. Lisp, Cobol. 
  Trying unsuccessfully to impose general languages​​: Algol, PL / 1.<br>
  - Years 70: Duel between structured programming with Pascal and efficiency of C language. Basic generalized  on personal computers from  1977, until the late 80s.<br>
  - Years 80: Experimentating other ways including objects. ML. Smalltalk. 
  On computers, we now use C, Pascal, Basic compiled.<br>
  - Years 90: Generalization of object-oriented programming with the performance of 
  microcomputers. Java, Perl, Python languages ​​in addition to microphones.<br>
- 2000s: Internet Programming (and future innovations, see end of text).<br>
- Years 2010: Concurrency  and asynchronicity. JavaScript and Go languages among others help to create  online fluid applications.</p>
<div class="scriptol"><p><b>First language</b></p>
  <p>Ada Lovelace and Babbage and its nephew were writing programs 
  for the project of "difference engine", and then the "analytical 
  engine".<br>
  In 1945, the german K. Zuse, inventor of the Z3 computer would have defined 
  an evolved language for this engine (with arrays and records). Few documents 
   of the epoch about this language exist. </p></div>


<div class="scriptol"><p><b>Assembly</b></p>
  <p> Assemblers exist since the beginning of computers. They associate 
  a symbolic name to the machine-language code, for example:
<pre>add bx, 4
cmp [adr], 3
jmp address&nbsp;
</pre>
  Assembly programming is no longer frequently practiced, even to build fast routines... </p></div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Autocode</b> - 1952 </p>
  <p>Alick E. Glennie </p>
  <p>Implemented firstly on Mark 1, then on other computers, this 
   is a symbolic code. </p></div>
   
  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>FLOW-MATIC</b> - 1955 </p>
 <p>Grace Hopper </p>
 <p>Feeling that a symbolic programming language is inaccessible to researchers, Grace Hopper wanted to use words for instructions of  the UNIVAC I. Separating  instructions and  data structures  was also new. A compiler was completed by 1958.</p>
  </div>   

 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>IPL</b> - 1956 - Information Processing Language</p>
   <p>A. Newell, H. Simon, J.C. Shaw </p>
   <p>Low-level list processing language. Implements the RECURSIVITY. </p></div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Fortran</b> - 1954-1958 - FORmula TRANslator system</p>
  <p>John Backus and other researchers at IBM</p>
  <p>Language 
  dedicated to mathematical calculations.<br>
  Fortran II (1958) introduced SUB-ROUTINES, FUNCTIONS, LOOPS, a primitive 
  FOR control structure.<br>
  Identifiers were limited to six characters. </p></div>
  
<div class="scriptol"><p><b>UNCOL</b> - 1958 - Universal Computer Oriented Language</p>
 <p>Melvin E. Conway</p>
 <p>This is the first bytecode, the first intermediate language, addressing the need to be able to write programs that run on all hardware. It has not been implemented but inspired subsequent projects such as UCSD p-System.</p>
</div>  
  
 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Lisp</b> - 1958-1960 - LISt Processing</p>
  <p>Mac Carthy</p>
  <p>Functional language for list processing. <br>
  It is purely recursive, and not iterative. There is no difference between 
   code and data.</p></div>
 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>IAL</b> - 1958 - International Algebraic Logic</p>
   <p>First name for Algol 58, never implemented. </p></div>
 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>ALGOL</b><strong> </strong>- 1960 / Algol W - 1966 / Algol 68 - ALGOrithmic 
  Language </p>
  <p>Defined by an international consortium of computer science specialists, 
  coordinated by IFIP.</p>
  <p><a href="http://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/" target="_top">Algol 
  Genie</a> </p>
  <p>This was the fist universal language to be machine independent.<br>
  Introduces the use of the BNF (Backus Naur Form) grammar to create a syntax 
  parser.<br>
  Introduces BLOCKS of STATEMENTS, and LOCAL VARIABLES inside a block.<br>
  Recursivity was implemented but with reticence as this was considered 
  as useless!<br>
  Uses DYNAMIC ARRAYS, and this means that following language (Pascal, C) 
  have regressed by using static arrays, for better performance.<br>
  It has IF THEN ELSE, FOR, the := symbol for assignment (used then by Pascal), 
  a SWITCH with gotos, the BEGIN END markers, the WHILE loop.<br><br>
  Algol W by Niklaus Wirth in 1966 was using RECORDS, that are dynamic data 
  structures, CASE, passing parameters by value, precedence of operators.<br>
  The same year, Niklaus Wirth has created Euler, a language between Algol 
  and Pascal. <br><br>
  Algol 60 was still oriented toward mathematical calculations. To try to 
  reach the original goal of a general purpose language, a new version has 
  been started in 1964, Algol X, renamed further Algol 68.<br>
  Algol 68 was using the =+ sign to merge both assignment and add. &nbsp;It 
  has introduced UNION and CAST of types. &nbsp;It owns IF THEN ELIF FI, 
  CASE, GOTO, user-defined operators.<br>
  Incremental compiling was not allowed. </p></div>
 <div class="scriptol">
   <p><b>COBOL</b> - 1960 - COmmon Business Oriented Language</p>
   <p>Defined by a committee, the CODASYL, COnference on DAta SYsystems 
  Languages</p>
  <p>The committee under the auspices of the Department Of Defense, 
  and manufacturers, universities and users, worked from may 1959 to april 
  1960.<br>
  Grace Murray Hopper, who had designed Flow-Matic, a compiled language 
  in the 50's, has participated to the committee.<br>
  Cobol is a classical procedural language aimed at enterprise management, 
  in wich a program is divided in 4 divisions: identification, environment, 
  data, procedure, and they may be divided in sections. It was founded on 
  data and a program must describe precisely the hardware and input/ouput 
  data format.<br>
  It introduced the RECORD data structure. Programs are documented by the 
   syntax and are all but ligthweight... </p></div>
   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>APL</b> - 1964 - A Programming Language</p>
  <p>K. Iverson</p>
  <p>Language using a mathematical notation, with lot of operators. 
  A unique type, the array.<br>
   Defined from 1957 to 1960, implemented in 1964. </p></div>
 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>BASIC</b><strong> </strong>- 1964 - Beginner&#146;s All-purpose Symbolic 
  Instruction Code </p>
  <p>John Kemeny, Thomas Kurtz</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scriptol.com/programming/basic.php" target="_top">Description</a></p>
  <p>Has been designed in 1963, to be easy to learn and has been 
  implemented in 1964. The first version was compiled, then it becomes interactive 
  and interpreted. Each line has a number to allow GOTOs statements to jump 
  to the line! <br>
  Bill Gate and Paul Allen have win an international contest by designing 
  and implementing a fast and compact Basic, firstly for the Altair (in 4 
  kb memory!) and then on other micro-computers.<br>
  Micro-computers were delivered with Basic in ROM until late 80.<br>
  In 1977, the Apple II was sold with an integer Basic. Then the Applesoft 
  Basic of Microsoft with floating-point. Applesoft was using two-letter 
  identifiers! Sub-programs were called by GOSUB to line numbers.<br>
  The first PC from IBM, (in 1981) was using MS-DOS from Microsoft and its 
  interpreted Basic (Basica). In 82 Microsoft produced its first compiled 
  Basic (Quick Basic).<br>
  Pascal and C have replaced Basic in the same decade. Microsoft still uses 
  Basic. Visual Basic for application, ASP for the web, and applications 
  are extended with a language (macro) that is basic also.<br>
  True Basic, by the original authors of the language is compiled and no longer 
  uses line numbers. </p>
</div>



  <div class="scriptol">
    <p><b>ISWIM</b> - 1966 - If You See What I Mean.</p>
    <p>P. Landin </p>
  <p>First purely fonctional language, in the mathematical sense. 
   The first to use LAZY EVALUATION.</p></div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Attribute grammars</b> - 1965</p>
  <p>Donald Knuth </p>
  <p>Completing the BNF method, attribute grammars describes 
  the semantic of languages to be made of functions.&nbsp;This type of grammar 
   helps the building of compilers. </p></div>


   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Simula 67</b> - 1962-67 </p>
  <p>Ole-Johan Dahl, Kristan Nygaard</p>
  <p>The Simula project started in 1962. The goal was to build 
  a tool to describe discrete event system, or network, and a language to 
  program simulating real world.<br>
  Was firstly designed as an Algol extension.<br>
  In 1964, Simula 1 has been implemented on Univac 1107. It was used to control 
  administrations, airports, planning, transport, or social systems.<br>
  This was a specialized tool. &nbsp;In 1966, it has been decided to make 
  it an universal language. Several projects has been launched with the 
  help of several makers (IBM, Univac, Digital) and this leaded to Simula 
  67.<br>
  This universal language has introduced CLASSES, INHERITANCE and OBJECTS 
  that are instances of classes. Classes allow to link functions (methods) 
  to objects. </p>
  </div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Logo</b> - 1966 </p>
  <p>Fuerzeig, Seymour Papert, and others</p>
  <p>Aimed to teach programming to children, near Lisp, and based 
   on moving a "turtle" on the screen.</p></div>


  <div class="scriptol">
    <p><b>SNOBOL  4</b> - 1967 - StroNg Oriented symBOlic Language</p>
    <p>D. J. Farber, R. E. Griswold, F. P. Polensky at Bells Labs </p>
  <p>Snobol appeared in 1962.<br>
  Snobol 4 is the first stable distributed version of Snobol, available in 
  1967.<br>
  This is a processor of strings, founded on the principle of <strong>pattern-matching</strong>, 
  concatenation and <strong>alternation</strong>.<br>
  It was the first language to implement <strong>associative arrays</strong>, indexed 
  by any type of keys.<br>
  It allows to run code stored inside strings. <br>
  Data types are: string, integer, real, array, table, pattern and user-defined 
   types. </p></div>


   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>CPL</b> - Combined Programming Language </p>
  <p>Cambridge and London Universities </p>
  <p> This was a combination of Algol 60 and functional language aimed at 
  proof of theorems. It was using polymorphic testing structures. Typed 
  language with the "any" joker type. Had list and array.<br>
  Complex, was not implemented. I quote it only because it was a step toward 
   the design of the C language. </p></div>



 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>BCPL</b> - 1965? - Basic CPL</p>
  <p>Martin Richards </p>
  <p>It has been intended to be a simplified version of CPL.<br>
  Was using these control structures: FOR, LOOP, IF THEN, WHILE, UNTIL, REPEAT, 
  REPEAT WHILE, SWITCH CASE, etc...<br>
  Owns procedures and functions, unlike C.<br>
  Block delimiters were $( ..... $) which has inspired probably /* ... */ 
   in C.</p></div>


   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>PL/1</b> - 1965? - Programming Language number One - Originally 
  NPL (New Programming Language)</p>
  <p>IBM</p>
  <p>The language was designed to be general-purpose and modular.<br>
  Keywords are reserved only in the context where they are used as keywords. <br>
  It is more hardware independent than predecessors. These types are recognized: 
  fixed, real, complex, character, bit, bin, pointer, picture, file, etc.... 
  Data have default attributes (as precision for example), that depends 
  upon the context.<br>
  These compound types are built-in: array, structures, unions, and combinations 
  of them. IF THEN and SELECT .. WHEN .. OTHERWISE are conditional structures, 
  and variations on the DO structure allows various conditional loops.<br>
  Storage classes are introduced: automatic, static (life of the program), 
  controlled, based. Exceptions are implemented.</p></div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Pascal</b> - 1970 - Named from the french mathematician 
  Blaise Pascal</p>
  <p>Niklaus Wirth</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scriptol.com/programming/pascal.php" target="_top">Description</a></p>
  <p> Language aimed to ease the building of compilers, and to lead teaching 
  by forcing to a structured programming.<br>
  UCSD Pascal, written by a group of programmers leaded away by Kenneth 
  Bowles is the first version for micro-computers. It compiles programs 
  in P-code, that is portable and interpreted (as Java later). It included 
  a complete development environment, a principle used successfully further 
  by Turbo Pascal.<br>
  In 1981, a role playing game written in Pascal, Wizardry, has had a big 
  success on Apple II.<br>
  When Turbo Pascal (by Anders hejlsberg) appeared in 1983 , fast and having 
  a complete IDE, the language gained success and is still widely used.<br>
  Control structures are near C ones. </p></div>
  

<div class="scriptol"><p><a href="http://www.forth.org" target="_top"><strong>Forth</strong></a> - 1971 - Fourth reduced to Forth by the constraint 
  of 5 letters of the IBM 1130</p>
  <p>Charles H. Moore</p>
  <p>Defined during 60+, seems to have been implemented in 1971.&nbsp;<br>
  Language for astronomical instruments using a stack to replace variables.<br>
  Its goal was to be the fourth generation language. </p></div>
 

 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Smalltalk</b> - 1972</p>
  <p>Alan Kay and the Software Concept Group</p>
  <p>This is a fully object oriented language wich runs always 
   inside a graphical environnment, with windows, mouse, etc...</p></div>


  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>C</b> - 1973 - C is the successor of B, which is the successor 
  of BCPL </p>
  <p>Dennis Ritchie</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scriptol.com/programming/c-language.php" target="_top">Description</a></p>
  <p> It was firstly destinated to program the UNIX operating system, but 
  has become quickly universal thanks to its portability and speed.<br>
  Allows incremental compiling. &nbsp;In 1965, ATT programmers were using 
  Bcpl to work on implementing Unix. Displeased with this language, they 
  made it evolve to a new version named B, then to a new language named 
  C.<br>
  This was the evolving of the hardware that instigate to create C. Bcpl 
  and B was using integer for pointers, but this was not working on the 
  new computers.<br>
  Bcpl has no type (as Php or other modern scripting languages!). The declarations 
  int i, char b were created in C. Other types will appear later.</p>  <p>The += operator comes from Algol 68 (but was written =+)<br>
  In Bcpl, a block of statements was enclosed inside the (* and *) symbols 
  as the comment in /* and */ and sub-expressions inside ( and ). I suppose 
  this symbolism was intended to denote that anything is an expression in 
  the language, and also to reduce the parsing time. The C language simplified 
  the writting with the { and } symbols, that does the original idea doesn't 
  remains. <br>
  Union and cast come from Algol 68.<br>
  ++ was already in the B language.<br>
  The keyword "include" comes from PL/I.<br>
  The preprocessor was implemented in 1973, and C has been used from this 
  date to write Unix, but Ritchie worked on it since 1969. The language 
 has evolved until 1980.&nbsp;. </p></div>


   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Prolog</b> - 1970+</p>
  <p>A. Colmerauer, D. Roussel</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gprolog/" target="_top">GNU 
  Prolog</a> </p>
  <p>Has been developped both in France at Aix-en-Provence and 
  at Edimburg.&nbsp;<br>
  Has introduced LOGIC PROGRAMMING. A program is made of Horn clauses.<br>
   Prolog is declarative, its system of logic inference is an engine of resolution. </p></div>


   <div class="scriptol">
     <p><b>SQL</b> - 1970+ - Standard Query Language</p>
     <p>IBM</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scriptol.com/programming/sql.php" target="_top">Description</a></p>
  <p>Language of query for relational databases. Successor of the 
   Square language. </p></div>
 

 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Awk</b> - 1974 - First letters of authors' names</p>
  <p>Aho, Kerninghan, Weinberger</p>
  <p>Word processing language based on regular expressions, using 
   a pattern-action principle. </p></div>
 

<div class="scriptol"><p><b>Scheme</b> - 1975 - From "schemmer" </p>
  <p>Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy L. Steele at MIT</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scheme.com/" target="_top"> Scheme</a></p>
  <p>Language derived from Lisp but simplified. Types are 
  boolean, integer of indefinite size, rational and complex, characters, 
  symbols, vectors, oriented pairs, lists, associative lists, hash tables. 
  The S-expression generic type is used to extend the language. <br>
  It is often used as a scripting language, by the Gimp for example.<br>
 The language and development tool Hop from Inria is Scheme extended into a functional HTML dialect to build 
   Web 2.0 application.</p>
</div>

<div class="scriptol">
  <p><b>CLU</b> - 75 - CLUster </p>
  <p>Barbara Liskov and MIT.</p>
  <p>Coming after  Simula, it brings the notion constructor of abstract type with  code for making it. Objects are called clusters (groups). It brings the iterator concept, an effective system of  exceptions handling, multiple assignments. These ideas were taken up by Python.</p>
</div>  

 <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Plasma</b> - 1975</p>
   <p>Carl Hewitt. &nbsp;</p>
   <p>Language of actors. Implemented in Lisp.</p></div>


  <div class="scriptol">
<p><b>Sasl</b> - 1976 - Saint Andrews Static Language</p>
  <p>D. Turner.</p>
  <p>Aimed to teach the functional programming.&nbsp;<br>
   Comes from Iswim, unlimited data structures.</p></div>



  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Icon</b> - 1977</p>
  <p>Griswold. </p>
  <p>Procedural&nbsp;language, with word processing function as Snobol4, and 
  powerful constructs. Probably the first language <strong>goal-oriented</strong> : an instruction is executed if an expression with a possible success or failure state is achieved.<br>
  It has structured types: list, set, table (dictionary).<br>
  A list is declared: name := [ "word", "word", number, 
  etc...]<br>
  A list may be indexed in the form a[i] or be used as a stack.<br>
  A "set" hold elements without doubloons, and has several functions: 
  union, intersection, removing.<br>
  The RANGE construct is written: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a to b &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  where "to" is a keyword and "a" and "b" 
  are variables..<br>
  A range may used inside an expression or as argument of a function. The 
  expression or the function are called with each value in the range.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Ex: write(1 to 5) will display 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5.<br>
  Expression don't return a boolean value, but are either evaluated or rejected. 
  The operation are executed if the expression may be evaluated. This is 
  the first language where expression evaluating it leaded by the GOAL.<br>
  There is a statement of the C language: if ( x= expression) ...&nbsp;which 
  means: assign to x the result of the expression, and if a is non zero, 
  then..., this construct is generalized in Icon, if the expression may 
  be evaluated, x gets the value, else x remains unchanged and the condition 
  is ignored.<br>
  The EVERY..DO construct associated to an expression works as an iterator. 
  As the range.<br>
  The ALTERNATION is another powerful construct. It allows to use a sequence 
  of parameters until a result is obtained. The symbol is "|".<br>
  For example the statement : if a | b | c = 0 | 1 means for.... &nbsp;if 
   a or b or c is 0 or 1 then ... </p>
  </div>


   <div class="scriptol"><p><b>ML</b> - 1973? - Meta Language</p>
  <p>R. Milner. </p>
  <p>Functional language inspired by Iswim.<br>
  Its goal was to proof theorem at the Edimburg University.<br>
  Functions are replaced by pattern models.<br>
   Implemented in Lisp.</p></div>



  <div class="scriptol"><p><b>Modula 2</b> - 1979 - MODUlar LAnguage</p>
  <p>Niklaus Wirth.</p>
  <p>Modula 1 would be defined in 1977. &nbsp;Implemented on 
  the Lilith workstation at first.<br>
  The idea is to reduce the risk of error with coercive programming rules. 
  However, it adds to Pascal some features of the C language. A call of 
  function without argument is written f() as in C rather than f as in Pascal. <br>
  A program is splitted in modules with local scope, and interfaces for other 
  modules. Use coroutines. Allows access to the hardware.<br>
  Was only used in Universities, because these new features has been added 
   also to Pascal by the makers of compilers (the units of Turbo Pascal mainly).</p></div>

  An end of bloc is denoted by inverted keywords: if fi, do od.<br>
  The for loop has the forms: for in list, for in from to.<br>
  The language has procedures and functions.<br>
  What made it apart if that variables point out values and not memory addresses,

  <p>Ruby has been designed as successor to Perl and alternative to Python, 
  to be clearer than the first one, and more object oriented than the 
  second one. The syntax comes from these two languages, it want to be 
  without surprise and natural but may be complex.<br>
  There is no new control structure as in Scriptol, but a lot of minor 
  innovations to make the code smaller.<br>
  It is an interpreted language easy to extend. Statements are terminated 
  by end of line. Blocks of statement and loop are delimited by "end". 
  Most Python's features are present: associative arrays, iterators...<br>
  The originality is the dynamic object feature (adding methods to instances)

    <p><a href="http://www.scriptol.com/programming/scriptol.php" target="_top">Description</a> </p>
  <p>  Scriptol (Scriptwriter Oriented Language) is either compiled in PHP or in C++ or native, giving it a great 
  portability. It is both a language for applications, for scripting and to 
  make dynamic web pages.<br>
  Blocs of statements and control structures are not closed by "end" 
  or "}" but, as in XML, with the form "/if", " 
  /for", "/while" and so on...<br>
  The language has new control structures: "for in", "while let", "scan by", etc... The "composite if"structure 
  eases to implement rules.<br>
  Variables and literals are objects. Basic object (number, text, etc...) and compound ones are created by direct assignment of a value or a list of arguments to the name.<br>
  Scriptol is destinated to evolve and to have, along classes, other high-level structures to allow programs to be nearest human thought. <br>
Since October 2003, Scriptol allows to use XML as internal data structure.</p>

  <dd> These languages allows to embed code inside HTML page and thus 
  to combine statements and data. PHP, ASP, JavaScript are the most 
  used ones. The .NET platform will allow any language to be embedded 
 into HTML.<br>
  Classes are being replaced by dynamic objects and inheritance by combination. </dd>
  <dt><b>Scripting languages</b></dt>
  <dd> In the 2000s, several modern scripting languages offer a simpler and  intuitive syntax:   Python is the 
 most widely used for now but is being replaced by Go. Ruby is mainly used for the Rail library but the trend is in Node and JavaScript. </dd>
  <dt><b>Markup languages</b> </dt>
  <dd>XML was a major trend in the 2000-2010 but is then dedicated to graphical interfaces. For documents it trends to be replaced by JSON.<br>
    Microsoft uses XAML to define graphical interfaces, on the Web with the cross-browsers 
  plug-in Silverlight or locally on .NET.<br>

 <dt><b>Portability</b></dt>
 <dd>Languages ​​become more portable thanks to LLVM and Emscriptem. The first for the virtual machine which runs on any system, the second by converting the LLVM code in JavaScript.</dd>
  <dt><b>Conclusion </b></dt>
 <dd> The development of mobile phones with their multiple operating systems foster HTML 5 as a development platform and related technologies: SVG, Canvas, CSS. JavaScript becomes the dominant language for client-side web applications.<br>
